				<p class="descripcion">
					Killed while saving a stranger from a traffic collision, a 34-year-old NEET is reincarnated into a world of magic as
                    Rudeus Greyrat, a newborn baby. With knowledge, experience, and regrets from his previous life retained, Rudeus 
                    vows to lead a fulfilling life and not repeat his past mistakes. Now gifted with a tremendous amount of magical
                    power and the mind of a grown adult, Rudeus is seen as a genius in the making by his new parents. Soon, he finds 
                    himself studying under powerful warriors, such as his swordsman father and a mage named Roxy Migurdia—all in 
                    order to hone his apparent talents. But despite his innocent exterior, Rudeus is still a perverted otaku, who uses 
                    his wealth of knowledge to make moves on women who would have been out of reach in his past life.
